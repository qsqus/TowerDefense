# Tower Defense Game

## Overview
The objective of this project was to create a tower defense game inspired by the 2007 game "PixelJunk Monsters." The game involves building defensive towers to protect your home from various enemies. There are seven different types of enemies, including two flying enemies and five ground enemies. Players can build four different types of towers: two that target only ground enemies, one that targets flying enemies, and one that can shoot at both types of foes. 

Players can upgrade towers by standing in them and can also sell them for a portion of their original cost. Defeated enemies drop coins, which can be used to purchase new towers. Each coin has a limited time on the ground. Towers can be built by standing inside of any tree on the map. Each time an enemy reaches the home base, the player loses one heart. If the player collides with an enemy, they lose one heart, drop some of their coins, and are temporarily immobilized. The player loses the game when their hearts reach zero. The goal is to survive all ten waves of enemies while retaining as many hearts as possible.
